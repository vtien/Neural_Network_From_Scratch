# Neural_Network_From_Scratch
In this project, I build a neural network from scratch, implementing a class structure, forward pass, and backward error propagation through gradient calculations to create a functioning neural network trained on the MNIST dataset using only numpy. This is then compared to a Pytorch neural network trained on the same dataset
